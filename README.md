### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jason

I'm a C++ developer interested in most domains that you typically find using the language. Nonetheless, my background is in science and math, so I'm particularly interested in applications like robotics/IOT devices and AI.

- I'm currently the technical founder of [Topoleg](https://www.topoleg.com/). Happily, we were able to get a couple of patents on the printed circuit boards, firmware, and software as a service that we built.

- I'm currently pursuing a C++ software development role as we have decided to sell the patents and hardware/software. We're not talking retirement price tags, so I'm not going to be heading off into the sunset any time soon.

- I've been programming for 20 years. Before college (so long ago I didn't bother to put it on LinkedIn), 
I started with a junior database job with the phone company (SBC, now AT&T)... that was before everyone knew Google would be the internet yellow pages. During that
time I took a course in C, and I've been a fan of C and C++ ever since.

- I did my PhD in Chemical Physics. Throughout my time in academia and teaching, I was always doing research that was computationally based, or taking on development work for the school while teaching.
