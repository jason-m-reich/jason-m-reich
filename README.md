### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jason

<a href="https://isocpp.org/"><img align="left" alt="C++ Logo" title="C++ Logo" width="30" height="34" src="images/cpp_logo.png"></a>
I'm a C++ developer interested in most domains that typically have a need for the language. My background is in science and math, so I'm particularly interested in scientific applications and complementary topics such as computational geometry. Computational geometry has been on my mind lately because of ray tracing (3D graphics) and route planning (autonomous vehicles, geographic information systems).

- I'm currently the technical founder of [Topoleg](https://www.topoleg.com/). Happily, we were able to get a couple of patents on the printed circuit boards, firmware, and software as a service that we built.

- I'm currently pursuing a C++ software development role as we have decided to sell the patents and hardware/software. We're not talking retirement price tags, so I'm not going to be heading off into the sunset any time soon.

- I've been programming for 20 years. Before college (so long ago I didn't bother to put it on LinkedIn), I started with a junior database developer role with the phone company (SBC, now AT&T)... that was before everyone knew Google would be the internet yellow pages. During that time I took a course in C, and I've been a fan of C and C++ ever since (although I didn't focus on C++ much until an independent project I took on in graduate school in 2009).

- I did my PhD in Chemical Physics. Throughout my time in academia and teaching, I was always doing computational theory research, or taking on development work for the school while teaching CS and math classes.
