### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jason

<a href="https://isocpp.org/"><img align="left" alt="C++ Logo" title="C++ Logo" width="30" height="34" src="images/cpp_logo.png"></a>
I'm a C++ developer with 10+ years experience in software engineering. My areas of interest include most domains that typically have a need for C++. 

My background is in science and math, so I'm particularly interested in scientific applications.

I work with C++, CMake, GoogleTest, vcpkg, Linux (Vim/shell scripts), Visual Studio, CLion, CI/CD, Git.
